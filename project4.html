                    In today's society everything is digital, from communication, news and even art. Being able to program is a major benefit for every designer or person in general. During the first year of my course we learned how to code with an artistic computer language
                    named Processing (which is basically Java).

                    With this program I was supposed to make five different challenges. The results of these challenges are seen on the pictures to the left.
                    <h3 style="text-align: center; ">Day 1</h3>
                </p>
                The first assignment was Dynamic Drawing and since I already have a background in programming, I felt very excited about applying my knowledge on this assignment. It is supposed to be a sketch that looks similar, but still different every time one refreshes
                the program. I was playing around with several ellipses and lines until I had a vision of what I actually wanted to make. My laptop generally has red colors (the keyboard and my desktop), so I thought about doing something with the color
                red. In the end I created the following creation and I call it Fifty Shades of Red: I scattered the different shades of red with the random function within the RGB system; I put blue and green between 0 to 50, and red between 50 and 255.
                I let the circles randomize between 0 and 200.
                </p>
                <h3 style="text-align: center; ">Day 2</h3>
                </p>
                This assignment was to create a simple game and the given examples were Pong, Snake, Pac-man or Flappy Bird. I thought about the games and which one of these I could make my own. As multiple people already know, I am an alcoholic, so the first thing I
                thought of was Pong but then the beer pong version. I first made the basic Pong game with two rectangles on the sides and a small ellipse bouncing in the middle and from there I developed it. I put in hand images instead of rectangles
                and created my own background in Illustrator. The game is basically the same, but now you have the feeling you can also play it at a party. The goal is for both players to reach five points. This can be achieved by letting the ball pass
                through the opponents side. The player on the left (red) can move W for up and S to move down, the player on the right (blue) can move with the arrow keys up and down to move. I intergrated the things I learned today by implementing these
                elements with the keyPressed function.
                </p>
                <h3 style="text-align: center; ">Day 3</h3>
                </p>
                On the third day the assignment is to make interactive patterns. The whole day I was messing around with lines, rectangles, ellipses and random colors. All my attempts failed and it didn’t really look interesting, let alone pretty. My ideas concluded
                on doing something with the original colors: red, green and blue. Eventually I put in rectangles that appear randomly while lines follow the mouse of the user. I wanted the lines to re-appear every frame, so I implemented the information
                of today’s lecture in this; a forloop. The user can draw with the program by moving around over the screen. If a key is pressed, the colors switch around between red, green and blue. If it is done quickly it gives a disco vibe in my opinion.
                </p>
                <h3 style="text-align: center; ">Day 4t</h3>
                </p>
                The next assignment is another game, but this time with a main character, enemies/obstacles and a score. The first thing I thought of an object sliding over the screen and receiving points for retrieving something else on the screen. Then I thought about
                how I missed my turtle at home (see picture on the left). So I made a game with a turtle. The user can slide the turtle over the screen with the arrow keys and gets a point every time. The obstacle in this game is a rock, because my turtle
                always tries to eat rocks instead of plants for some reason. If the user gets points, they go up a level until level 5. If the user reaches level 5 they win the game, if they hit the rock in the meantime they lose. I was finished before
                the day ended so I thought of ways to improve the game, that is the reason why there is music playing during the game. The song is called ‘Down With the Sickness’ from Disturbed, I thought it very accurately fits the vibe of the game and
                improves the user experience while playing.

                <h3 style="text-align: center; ">Day 5t</h3>
                </p>
                The last day we received an open assignment, which means we can do whatever we want as long as it includes shapes, colors, user input, conditionals, functions, loops and arrays. The whole day at The Hague Tech I was looking up videos and other people’s
                programs to get some ideas to what I was going to do. At the end of the day I found a person on openprocessing.org that made a drawing of a person with randomized lines (see picture on the right). This inspired me to replicate my own image
                with brush strokes. I implemented: </br> 1) Color, by letting my images be redrawn in their original color. </br> 2) User input, by being able to press any key to change the picture. </br> 3) Conditionals, by programming
                several if statements containing conditionals. </br> 4) Functions, by coding the strokes outside of the draw function and it its own function. </br> 5) For loops, by letting a double for loop draw the random brush strokes. 6) Arrays, by
                starting with a string array at the top that will show the three different images. The pictures that I used in this program are my own made photographs from San Francisco, Morocco and a flower garden.
