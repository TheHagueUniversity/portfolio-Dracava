                    My name is Daphne Varekamp and I am a UX Design student at The Hague University in The Netherlands. I'm born and raised in this city, however I often leave the country to explore other places and cultures. I have the tendency to document a lot of my experiences
                    for some reason, so it's a given that I am into photography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the need to search for aesthetically pleasing pictures I also developed an obsession for art. During my entire life I expressed myself through drawing and painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In high school I learned myself how to edit videos, since I created a lot of footage to work with. Later on I became involved in animal activism and I was hired by the non-profit organisation Animal Rights to be a video-editor for undercover footage from
                    breeding farms and slaughterhouses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, the hard skills I obtained are photography, design, drawing, video-editing, English proficiency and programming. The soft skills I possess are creative, empathetic, organized, social and easily adaptive.
