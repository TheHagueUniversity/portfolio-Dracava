                <p>
                    Since I already paint and draw since ever I could remember, I often get requests by people to paint or draw something for them as well.

                    Several acquaintances of mine offered me assignments to draw or something for them digitally. My final digital projects are seen on the left.

                    Making my own art shows a good eye for design and aesthetics. Furthermore, being a self-employed freelance artist shows good communication skills, independence and self-sufficiency.
