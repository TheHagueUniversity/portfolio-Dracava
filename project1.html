                    In high school I had a class which abbreviation was CKV. This class contained a lot of art related subjects.

                <p>
                    For this class we had the assignment of making an artistic video which was a retell of a fairy tale. It was obliged that there should be a twist in the story and we were free to take our own take on it.

                    I personally love horror movies and I decided to tell the story of red riding hood. In Dutch the name of this is tale is "roodkapje" and I changed the title to "doodkapje" which roughly translates to dead riding hood.

                <p>
                    The final product was graded with a 10/10 and I completed the class with distinction.
